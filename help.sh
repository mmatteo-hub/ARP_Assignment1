# adding path and file .txt to the help.sh file to show in the shell

echo "######## PROGRAM PREPARATION ########
To prepare the program for the execution there are some steps to be completed:
0 - read the brief description below for each process to understand the general purpose and strcture of the program;
1 - type '$ ./install.sh <path name>' and press enter. The <path name> has to be the name of a folder (the folder will be created inside the actual folder, so do not give a gloabl path since the next step will not be done succesfully);
1.1 - check that, once the install.sh has completed, a message will be shown on the shell;
2- type  '$ ./run.sh' and, if everything has been done correctly, the program will start automatically.

To be sure the program is started correctly you should see:
- 2 consoles, named inspection and command console, waiting for some inputs;
- the main shell waiting for command too."
