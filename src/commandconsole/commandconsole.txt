################ COMMAND CONSOLE ################

The COMMAND CONSOLE is one the two programs, with the INSPECTION CONSOLE, which take inputs from user and drive the motors.
It has the work to read the input from a menù, showed at the console, and senta the option to the respective motor.

It communicates with MOTOR X and Z by named pipes; it has also the possibility to send message to the WATCHDOG to advertise it for the arrival of a command.

It has a control to detect if the input taken is from the menù:
- commands are composed only by 1 charcter
- the program reads both uppercase and lowercase as well.

To have a cleaner output, the prorgram clears all at avery iteration.
