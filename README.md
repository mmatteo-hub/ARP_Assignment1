# ARP Assignment 1
This is the shared repository to work on the assignment 1 of the Advanced and Robot Programming course

to run the program
* check for executable permission of file `konsole.sh` by: `ls -l`

  * if yes run `./konsole.sh`

The `.sh` file already compiles all executables output for each `.c` file.
